<strong> Upwelling is when ocean water hits the continental shelf and moves upwards. Which of the following is an important role of upwelling? 
</strong>
<p>(A) it increases the density of the water 
</p>
<p>(B) it removes oxygen from the water 
</p>
<p>(C) it lowers the salt content of the water 
</p>
<p>(D) ** it moves nutrients up through the water

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Water that rises to the surface as a result of upwelling is typically colder and is rich in nutrients. These nutrients “fertilize” surface waters, meaning that these surface waters often have high biological productivity. Therefore, good fishing grounds typically are found where upwelling is common.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The upward movement of this deep, colder water is called upwelling. The deeper water that rises to the surface during upwelling is rich in nutrients. These nutrients “fertilize” surface waters, encouraging the growth of plant life, including phytoplankton.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Brings the nutrient-rich ocean waters to the surface Not only does ocean upwelling bring the cold and deep ocean waters to the surface of the coast, but it also brings the water to the coastlines that are rich in nutrients. This happens due to the blowing winds and the rotation of the Earth on its axis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Upwelling occurs where surface currents are diverging, or moving away from each other. As the surface waters diverge, deeper water must be brought to the surface to replace it, creating upwelling zones. The upwelled water is cold and rich in nutrients, leading to high productivity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Upwelling is an oceanic process in which cold water from the deep rises toward the surface of the ocean. It is caused by strong winds and the rotation of the Earth which moves warmer surface waters offshore allowing the cold, nutrient rich water to rush up.
