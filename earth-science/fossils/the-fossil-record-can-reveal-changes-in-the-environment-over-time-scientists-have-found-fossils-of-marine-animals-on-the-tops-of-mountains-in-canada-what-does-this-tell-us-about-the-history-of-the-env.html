<strong> The fossil record can reveal changes in the environment over time. Scientists have found fossils of marine animals on the tops of mountains in Canada. What does this tell us about the history of the environment in that area? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** The mountains were once sediment at the bottom of an ocean. 
</p>
<p>(B) The ancient environment in the area did not favor fossilization. 
</p>
<p>(C) The ancient environment in the area was much drier than it is today. 
</p>
<p>(D) The mountains formed before the animals died, and their remains were fossilized.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The fossil record can reveal changes in the environment over time. Scientists have found fossils of marine animals on the tops of mountains in Canada. What does this tell us about the history of the environment in that area? The mountains were once sediment at the bottom of an ocean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Many small organisms can be preserved within these layers of sediment through time. The changing abundances of these fossils through time can tell us whether a change in the environment or climate was gradual or abrupt. Studying fossil pollen and other fossils helps scientists to learn more about climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils provide solid evidence that organisms from the past are not the same as those found today; fossils show a progression of evolution. Fossils, along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms, constitute the morphological, or anatomical, record.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-They can teach us where life and humans came from, show us how the Earth and our environment have changed through geological time, and how continents, now widely separated, were once connected. Fossils provide important evidence for evolution and the adaptation of plants and animals to their environments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When these animals died from 15 million to 20 million years ago, their carcasses settled to the ocean floor and were embedded in submarine sediments. But since then, the violent upthrusting of the Andean chain has carried the sediments to the tops of mountains.
