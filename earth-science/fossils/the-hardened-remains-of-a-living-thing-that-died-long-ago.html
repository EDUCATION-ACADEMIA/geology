<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Preserved evidence of the body parts of ancient animals, plants and other life forms are called ‘body fossils’. ‘Trace fossils’ are the evidence left by organisms in sediment, such as footprints, burrows and plant roots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Desiccation, also known as Mummification, is a very unique and rare form of fossilization. Desiccated/mummified fossils are next in quality to the frozen fossils. Bones and tissues of these desiccated organisms of the desert are preserved, although they often fall apart at the slightest touch.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils are the remains or traces of ancient life that have been preserved by natural processes. Examples of fossil include shells, bones, stone imprints of animals or microbes, exoskeletons, objects preserved in amber, petrified wood, coal, hair, oil, and DNA remnants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There are four main types of fossils, all formed in a different way, which are conducive to preserving different types of organisms. These are mold fossils, cast fossils, trace fossils and true form fossils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fossilization is an extremely rare process that occurs in some sedimentary environments and causes the hard remains of plants or animals to be preserved as fossils in the earth’s crust. Prior to fossilization, most organic materials are not very durable.
