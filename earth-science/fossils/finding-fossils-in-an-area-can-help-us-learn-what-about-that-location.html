<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fossils give us a useful insight into the history of life on Earth. They can teach us where life and humans came from, show us how the Earth and our environment have changed through geological time, and how continents, now widely separated, were once connected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossils of any kind are useful in “reading the rock record, ” meaning they help us decipher the history of the earth. They can help us determine the geologic age and environment (the paleoenvironment) in which they were deposited.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils are direct evidence of evolution. It tells about the life found on ancient earth. By studying fossil records palaeontologists reveal the connecting link between different organisms of the past and present. The fossils present in the different layers of earth determine the age of the organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Examples include bones, teeth, shells, leaf impressions, nests, and footprints. This evidence reveals what our planet was like long ago. Fossils also show how animals changed over time and how they are related to one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined.
