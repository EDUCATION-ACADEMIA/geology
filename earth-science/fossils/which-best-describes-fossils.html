<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fossils are the remains or traces of ancient life that have been preserved by natural processes. Examples of fossil include shells, bones, stone imprints of animals or microbes, exoskeletons, objects preserved in amber, petrified wood, coal, hair, oil, and DNA remnants. There are five types of fossils: Body Fossils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossils are the preserved remains of plants and animals whose bodies were buried in sediments, such as sand and mud, under ancient seas, lakes and rivers. Fossils also include any preserved trace of life that is typically more than 10 000 years old.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which of these answer BEST describes a fossil? fossils are remains or traces of once-living organisms found in layers of rock or ice, or in amber.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the past. Fossils are important evidence for evolution because they show that life on earth was once different from life found on earth today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Trace fossils provide evidence of the activities of ancient organisms. Fossil footprints, trails, and burrows are examples of trace fossils.
