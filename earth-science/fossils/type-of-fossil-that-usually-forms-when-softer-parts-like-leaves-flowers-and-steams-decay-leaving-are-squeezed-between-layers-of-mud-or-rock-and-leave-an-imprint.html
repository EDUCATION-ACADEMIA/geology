<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Carbonized fossil – forms when organisms or parts, like leaves, stems, flowers, fish, are pressed between layers of soft mud or clay that hardens squeezing almost all the decaying organism away leaving the carbon imprint in the rock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Body Fossils – Soft Parts These can be mould and cast fossils, like most of the fossilized dinosaur skeletons and big bones we see, replacement fossils, like petrified wood, or whole-body fossils – mammoths caught in the ice, or insects trapped in amber.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Mold Fossil: Forms when sediments bury an organism and the sediments change into rock; the organism decays leaving a cavity in the shape of the organism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A mold is formed when an organism dies and the remains decay, leaving behind an imprint in the sediment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Most fossils that exhibit “soft part” preservation are carbonizations. Examples include many plant fossils (also known as compressions), insect fossils, and the famous fossils of the Burgess Shale.
