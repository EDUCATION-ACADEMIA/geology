The hard parts of organisms, such as bones, shells, and teeth have a better chance of becoming fossils than do softer parts.These include the intact remains of organisms and often include preserved skin, muscle, bone, hair and internal organs. Soft tissue fossils form in special circumstances that often need rapid burial and low oxygen environments that stop the organism from decomposing or being scavenged by other organisms.The most common process of fossilization happens when an animal is buried by sediment, such as sand or silt, shortly after it dies.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When an organism is buried quickly, there is less decay and the better the chance for it to be preserved. The hard parts of organisms, such as bones, shells, and teeth have a better chance of becoming fossils than do softer parts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-These include the intact remains of organisms and often include preserved skin, muscle, bone, hair and internal organs. Soft tissue fossils form in special circumstances that often need rapid burial and low oxygen environments that stop the organism from decomposing or being scavenged by other organisms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The most common process of fossilization happens when an animal is buried by sediment, such as sand or silt, shortly after it dies. Its bones are protected from rotting by layers of sediment. As its body decomposes all the fleshy parts wear away and only the hard parts, like bones, teeth, and horns, are left behind.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Animals that live in water are more likely to be fossilized because they are more easily buried in sediment. Hard or soft parts? Organisms with soft parts are rarely preserved because the soft tissue rapidly decomposes. Hard parts such as bones and shells are more readily fossilized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Animals with hard parts are more likely to be preserved than animals that have soft bodies. Aquatic animals are more likely to be preserved than terrestrial animals because water ecosystems have greater preservation potential.
