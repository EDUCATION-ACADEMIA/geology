<strong> A student saw sharp rocks on his way to a stream, and saw smooth rocks in the stream. Why were the rocks in the stream smoother? 
</strong>
<p>(A) because wind wears down rocks 
</p>
<p>(B) ** because moving water wears down rocks 
</p>
<p>(C) because wind breaks rocks into smaller pieces 
</p>
<p>(D) becuase moving water breaks down rocks into smaller pieces

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The water currents in rivers bring about the process of weathering, wherein rocks are smoothened and polished.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Transport of pebbles in a stream causes them to collide and rub against one another and the stream bed, and the resulting abrasion produces the familiar smooth and rounded shape of river rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Pieces of rock are chipped away and rough edges in rocks and sediments themselves become rounded. The bedrock beneath streams is also eroded by abrasion. Sediment flowing in the water can cut deeply into the bedrock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-River rocks tend to be smooth and round because of a combination of the geologic processes of erosion and weathering. Rocks are eroded from surrounding areas and are initially rough and jagged, but over many years they are weathered via transport-induced abrasion to become smooth and rounded.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earths surface. Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and minerals away. Water, acids, salt, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering and erosion.
