<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This is known as uniformitarianism: the idea that Earth has always changed in uniform ways and that the present is the key to the past. The principle of uniformitarianism is essential to understanding Earth’s history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-uniformitarianism, in geology, the doctrine suggesting that Earth’s geologic processes acted in the same manner and with essentially the same intensity in the past as they do in the present and that such uniformity is sufficient to account for all geologic change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-1. Uniformitarianism is best stated in the phrase, “The present is the key to the past.” Paraphrased, it says that processes that operate today are those that shaped the geology of the past. It suggests a very slow, gradual progress to geologic process that are found in the rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Today, we hold uniformitarianism to be true and know that great disasters such as earthquakes, asteroids, volcanoes, and floods are also part of the regular cycle of the earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism is a theory based on the work of James Hutton and made popular by Charles Lyell in the 19th century. This theory states that the forces and processes observable at earth’s surface are the same that have shaped earth’s landscape throughout natural history.
