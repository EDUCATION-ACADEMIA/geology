<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-law of superposition, a major principle of stratigraphy stating that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively younger with ascending order in the sequence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that any geological feature that cuts across or disrupts another feature must be younger than the feature that is disrupted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Principle of cross-cutting relationships. The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a rock unit (or other geological feature, such as a fault) that is cut by another rock unit (or feature) must be older than the rock unit (or feature) that does the cutting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Steno stated that sedimentary rocks are formed in continuous, horizontal layers, with younger layers on top of older layers. A century later, James Hutton discovered the law of cross-cutting relationships: a fault or igneous intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Law of Superposition Newer or younger rock layers are found on top. Older rock layers are found at the bottom. Scientists can read layers of rock knowing that each layer of sediment is deposited on top of older layers.
