<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Geologic History The presence of marine organisms in a rock indicates that the region where the rock was deposited was once marine. Sometimes fossils of marine organisms are found on tall mountains indicating that rocks that formed on the seabed were uplifted (Figure below).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Centuries ago, scholars puzzled over how seashells could wind up on the tops of mountains. Fossil seashells are now recognized as the remains of ancient sea floors raised to high altitudes by mountain building.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Due to the movement of plates on the Earthâ€™s surface, the ocean crust has collided with the continents and caused mountains and mountain ranges to form. As a result, the remains of the sea creatures that are deposited on the ocean floor are now exposed in the mountains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In Nepal, ammonites (marine cephalopods with shells) are found along the bed of the Kali Gandaki River. Climbers who have been to the top of Mount Everest brought back rocks in which the fossils of sea lilies were discovered.
