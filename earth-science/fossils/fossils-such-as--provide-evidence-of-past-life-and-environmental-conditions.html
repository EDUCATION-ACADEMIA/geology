<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Trace fossils provide us with indirect evidence of life in the past, such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As pieces of once living things, body fossils are evidence of what was living where and when. Trace fossils are valuable because they “animate” the ancient animals or plants by recording a moment of an organism’s life when it was still alive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Many small organisms can be preserved within these layers of sediment through time. The changing abundances of these fossils through time can tell us whether a change in the environment or climate was gradual or abrupt. Studying fossil pollen and other fossils helps scientists to learn more about climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Ichnofossils, also known as trace fossils, are geological records of the activities and behaviors of past life. Some examples include rock evidence of nests, burrows, footprints, and scat. These fossils are different from body fossils that preserve the actual remains of a body such as shells or bones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Some of the types of fossil evidence commonly used by scientists include trace fossils, molds and casts, replacement fossils, petrified fossils, amber and original material fossils. A trace fossil is any indirect evidence left by an organisms.
