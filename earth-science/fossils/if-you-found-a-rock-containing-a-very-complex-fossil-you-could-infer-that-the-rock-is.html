<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The location of fossils in rock layers provides evidence of Earth’s past landscapes. It is hard to guess the age of rock. Scientists have to act like detectives, piecing together a mystery to determine how long ago rocks formed. Fossils found in a particular rock layer help scientists determine the age of the rock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A fossil is the remains or traces of prehistoric life. Fossils are the preserved remains of an animal, such as the animal’s bones, or impressions of the animal’s activities, such as footprints. Even poop can be considered a fossil. It’s important to remember that plants can be fossils too!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Most fossils “hide out” in sedimentary rock . When tiny bits of rocks and minerals (called sediment) join together over millions of years, they become sedimentary rock. Plants and animals that become sandwiched in this sediment eventually turn into fossils. Two examples of sedimentary rocks are sandstone and shale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-To establish the age of a rock or a fossil, researchers use some type of clock to determine the date it was formed. Geologists commonly use radiometric dating methods, based on the natural radioactive decay of certain elements such as potassium and carbon, as reliable clocks to date ancient events.
