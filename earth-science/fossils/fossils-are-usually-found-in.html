<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Almost all fossils are preserved in sedimentary rock. Organisms that live in topographically low places (such as lakes or ocean basins) have the best chance of being preserved. This is because they are already in locations where sediment is likely to bury them and shelter them from scavengers and decay.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Sedimentary rocks have the ability to retain fossils because unlike most igneous and metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks occurs at temperatures and pressure that do not obliterate fossil remnants. Therefore, fossils are found in sedimentary rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The dead plants and animals, where they are buried by more sediment results in the accumulation of minerals from water in bones which leads to formation of fossils. This makes sedimentary rocks the only rock type to contain fossils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Fossils are most common in limestones. That is because most limestones consist partly or mostly of the shells of organisms. Sometimes, however, the shells are worn so much that they look like sediment grains rather than “real” fossils. Fossils are also common in shales, which form from muds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fossils are commonly found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks are the most common type of rock since they are formed by the earth’s natural forces like wind and water. Q. Sometimes igneous and sedimentary rocks are changed into metamorphic rocks.
