Fossils of the simplest organisms are found in the oldest rocks, and fossils of more complex organisms in the newest rocks. This supports Darwins theory of evolution, which states that simple life forms gradually evolved into more complex ones.By comparing the fossils of different organisms, it is possible to tell the phylogenetic relationships between organisms. Fossil records also show a gradual increase in complexity of organisms over time.Paleontologists were able to detect the particular order in which these organisms have lived.

<strong> How does the fossil record help to support the theory of evolution? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** the fossil record shows that organisms slowly change over time 
</p>
<p>(B) The fossil record shows that species evolve very quickly 
</p>
<p>(C) The fossil record does not support the theory of evolution

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fossils document the existence of now-extinct species, showing that different organisms have lived on Earth during different periods of the planet’s history. They can also help scientists reconstruct the evolutionary histories of present-day species.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Key Points. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the past. Fossils are important evidence for evolution because they show that life on earth was once different from life found on earth today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The fossil record Fossil remains have been found in rocks of all ages. Fossils of the simplest organisms are found in the oldest rocks, and fossils of more complex organisms in the newest rocks. This supports Darwin’s theory of evolution, which states that simple life forms gradually evolved into more complex ones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-By comparing the fossils of different organisms, it is possible to tell the phylogenetic relationships between organisms. Fossil records also show a gradual increase in complexity of organisms over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Paleontologists were able to detect the particular order in which these organisms have lived. For instance, simpler organisms inhabited older rocks and complex organisms were found in younger rocks. This finding has made them conclude that simple organisms have evolved into more complex organisms over time.
