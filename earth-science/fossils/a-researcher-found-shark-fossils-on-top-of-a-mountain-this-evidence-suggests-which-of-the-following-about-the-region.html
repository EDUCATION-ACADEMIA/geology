<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A researcher found shark fossils on top of a mountain. This evidence suggests which of the following about this region? It was once covered by an ocean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Fossils provide important evidence for evolution and the adaptation of plants and animals to their environments. Fossil evidence provides a record of how creatures evolved and how this process can be represented by a ‘tree of life’, showing that all species are related to each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the past. Fossils are important evidence for evolution because they show that life on earth was once different from life found on earth today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Many small organisms can be preserved within these layers of sediment through time. The changing abundances of these fossils through time can tell us whether a change in the environment or climate was gradual or abrupt. Studying fossil pollen and other fossils helps scientists to learn more about climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Most fossils “hide out” in sedimentary rock . When tiny bits of rocks and minerals (called sediment) join together over millions of years, they become sedimentary rock. Plants and animals that become sandwiched in this sediment eventually turn into fossils. Two examples of sedimentary rocks are sandstone and shale.
