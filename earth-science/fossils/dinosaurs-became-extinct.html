<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-No! After the dinosaurs died out, nearly 65 million years passed before people appeared on Earth. However, small mammals (including shrew-sized primates) were alive at the time of the dinosaurs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Around 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, an asteroid struck the Earth, triggering a mass extinction that killed off the dinosaurs and some 75% of all species. Somehow mammals survived, thrived, and became dominant across the planet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-When the conditions on the Earth changed mammals evolved into larger than they were at the time of the dinosaurs and we eventually came about. So, simply put dinosaurs came before humans because that’s what the environmental conditions permitted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In fact, life existed for hundreds of millions of years before the dinosaurs. And early life came in many shapes and sizes! Some of the most interesting animals lived during the Carboniferous period. At that time, Earth was covered in hot, humid swamps and rainforests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-They would still probably be small, scrawny, and very generalized. But instead, the mammals were able to evolve and diversify and, well, ultimately, millions of years later, become some humans. So perhaps we would not have been here if it weren’t for this extinction event 65 million years ago.
