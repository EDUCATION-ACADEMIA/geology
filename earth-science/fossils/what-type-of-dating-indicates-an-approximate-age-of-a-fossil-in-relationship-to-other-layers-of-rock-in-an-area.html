<p>(B) Absolute Dating

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Relative age dating is used to determine whether one rock layer (or the fossils in it) are older or younger than another base on their relative position: younger rocks are positioned on top of older rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To establish the age of a rock or a fossil, researchers use some type of clock to determine the date it was formed. Geologists commonly use radiometric dating methods, based on the natural radioactive decay of certain elements such as potassium and carbon, as reliable clocks to date ancient events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In geology, absolute dating can tell us the approximate age in years of the rock. The main way absolute dating is carried out is by Radiometric dating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Relative dating is used to arrange geological events, and the rocks they leave behind, in a sequence. The method of reading the order is called stratigraphy (layers of rock are called strata). Relative dating does not provide actual numerical dates for the rocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-This is called relative dating. Relative dating tells scientists if a rock layer is “older” or “younger” than another. This would also mean that fossils found in the deepest layer of rocks in an area would represent the oldest forms of life in that particular rock formation.
