Intrusive Igneous Rocks: Intrusive, or plutonic, igneous rock forms when magma is trapped deep inside the Earth.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-These are called intrusive igneous rocks because the magma has intruded into pre-exiting rock layers. Types of intrusive igneous rocks are granite and basalt. The diagram above shows you a large intrusive igneous body called a batholith. A batholith is the largest of the intrusive bodies.

<strong>Concept note-3:

<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Difference Between Batholith and Laccolith: Batholith occurs as individual igneous intrusive rock, while laccolith occurs as an intrusion in sedimentary rocks. Batholiths form when many plutons get together to form a granitic rock, and laccolith forms when high-pressure magma move the strata of sedimentary rocks.
