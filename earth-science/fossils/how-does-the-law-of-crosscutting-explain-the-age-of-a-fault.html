<strong> How does the law of crosscutting explain the age of a fault? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The fault is younger than the rocks above it. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The fault is younger than the rocks it cuts through. 
</p>
<p>(C) The fault is older than the rocks above it. 
</p>
<p>(D) The fault is older than the rocks it cuts through.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a fault or intrusion is younger than the rocks that it cuts through. The fault cuts through all three sedimentary rock layers (A, B, and C) and also the intrusion (D). So the fault must be the youngest feature.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A fault is a break in the Earth’s crust. A fault is always younger than the rock it cuts through. It makes the layers not line up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cross-cutting relationships is a principle of geology that states that the geologic feature which cuts another is the younger of the two features. It is a relative dating technique in geology.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The principle of cross-cutting relationships states that a rock unit (or other geological feature, such as a fault) that is cut by another rock unit (or feature) must be older than the rock unit (or feature) that does the cutting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Explanation: The law of superposition logically states that the strata at a lower level is older than the strata above it. The cross cutting is younger than the strata that it cuts through. If the cross cutting is “cut” off at an higher level it indicates a period of erosion.
