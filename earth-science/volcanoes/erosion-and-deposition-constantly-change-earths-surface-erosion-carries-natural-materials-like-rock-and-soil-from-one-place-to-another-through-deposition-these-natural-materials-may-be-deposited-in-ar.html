<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer. Answer: The material moved by erosion is sediment. Deposition occurs when the agents (wind or water) of erosion lay down sediment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Earth’s surface is constantly changed by erosion and deposition. Erosion breaks down Earth’s surface by carrying materials away from an area. Deposition builds up Earth’s surface when these materials are deposited in an area over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Erosion is the geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sediment is created through the process of weathering, carried away through the process of erosion, and then dropped in a new location through the process of deposition. When wind and water slow down, they drop the sediments they are carrying.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. It has led to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers, clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species. And degraded lands are also often less able to hold onto water, which can worsen flooding.
