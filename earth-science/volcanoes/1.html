<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Earthquakes are usually caused when a rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The third type of plate boundary occurs where tectonic plates slide horizontally past each other. This is known as a transform plate boundary. As the plates rub against each other, huge stresses can cause portions of the rock to break, resulting in earthquakes. Places where these breaks occur are called faults.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Transform Boundary A transform fault will form between tectonic plates where each plate moves away from the divergent plate boundary. The earthquakes that occur at boundaries cause stress through the crust of the Earth; rocks at the surface will break in response to the stress-forming faults.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The elastic rebound theory suggests that if slippage along a fault is hindered such that elastic strain energy builds up in the deforming rocks on either side of the fault, when the slippage does occur, the energy released causes an earthquake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-About 80% of earthquakes occur where plates are pushed together, called convergent boundaries. Another form of convergent boundary is a collision where two continental plates meet head-on. Since neither plate is stronger than the other, they crumple and are pushed up.
