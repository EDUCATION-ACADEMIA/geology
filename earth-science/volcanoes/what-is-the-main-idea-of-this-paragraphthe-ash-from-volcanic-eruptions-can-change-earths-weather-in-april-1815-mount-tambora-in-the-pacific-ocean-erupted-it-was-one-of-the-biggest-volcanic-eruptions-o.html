<title>What is the main idea of this paragraph?The ash from volcanic eruptions can change Earths weather. In April 1815, Mount Tambora in the Pacific Ocean erupted. It was one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of all time. It sent a huge ash cloud into the sky. For more than a year, the weather everywhere on Earth was different. Summers were cold and cloudy. Snow fell and lakes froze, even in June! All this because a volcano erupted!

<strong> What is the main idea of this paragraph?"The ash from volcanic eruptions can change Earth’s weather. In April 1815, Mount Tambora in the Pacific Ocean erupted.

Snow fell and lakes froze, even in June! All this because a volcano erupted!” 
</strong>
<p>(A) Volcanoes send ash into the sky. 
</p>
<p>(B) Volcanoes can be very powerful. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Volcanoes can have an effect on the weather. 
</p>
<p>(D) Volcanoes have erupted throughout history.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Large eruption columns inject ash particles and sulfur-rich gases into the troposphere and stratosphere and these clouds can circle the globe within weeks of the volcanic activity. The small ash particles decrease the amount of sunlight reaching the surface of the earth and lower average global temperatures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When Indonesia’s Mount Tambora erupted in 1815, it unleashed the most destructive wave of extreme weather the world has witnessed in thousands of years. The volcano’s massive sulfate dust cloud enveloped the Earth, cooling temperatures and disrupting major weather systems for more than three years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by 0.4–0.7 °C (0.7–1 °F). Summer temperatures in Europe were the coldest of any on record between the years of 1766 and 2000.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Deep within the Earth it is so hot that some rocks slowly melt and become a thick flowing substance called magma. Since it is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some of the magma pushes through vents and fissures to the Earth’s surface.
