<title>Which question can be answered by reading this paragraph?Volcanoes are mostly the same on the inside. A long skinny tube called a pipe forms the center of a volcano. The pipe starts at a pool of hot, liquid rock called a magma chamber. The pipe goes all the way up to the crater. The crater is the opening at the top of the volcano. This is where the volcanos vent is found. The vent is a crack in Earths surface. It lets smoke, ash, and lava out of the volcano.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A volcano is an opening in a planet or moon’s crust through which molten rock, hot gases, and other materials erupt. Volcanoes often form a hill or mountain as layers of rock and ash build up from repeated eruptions. Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Conduit-The channelway or passage, which may be pipe-shaped, that brings magma from a reservoir or chamber to the vent at the surface where it is erupted. Lava flow-An outpouring of molten rock from a vent onto Earth’s surface during an effusive volcanic eruption; also the resulting solidified body of rock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Scientists realized long ago that no two volcanoes erupt the same. Some, like Mount St. Helens, burst violently and send ash and gas high into the air. Others, like Kilauea in Hawaii, ooze red hot lava which runs like maple syrup down the slope of the volcano.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone.
