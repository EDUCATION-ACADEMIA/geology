<strong> An earthquake occurs when forces and stress along a fault build up, causing the rock to break at a weak point along the fault and release energy. How does this energy move through the Earth? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** as seismic waves 
</p>
<p>(B) as sound vibrations 
</p>
<p>(C) as heat waves 
</p>
<p>(D) as light radiation

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Earthquakes are the result of sudden movement along faults within the Earth. The movement releases stored-up ‘elastic strain’ energy in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth and cause the ground surface to shake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The friction across the surface of the fault holds the rocks together so they do not slip immediately when pushed sideways. Eventually enough stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in waves that travel through the rock to cause the shaking that we feel during an earthquake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth’s crust and cause the shaking that we feel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Surface rupture occurs when movement on a fault deep within the earth breaks through to the surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Earthquake occurs due to the movement of tectonic plates and because of this movement pressure builds up. When pressure is released, it results in earthquake.
