<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Birds have scales like many dinosaurs and some dinosaurs may have had feathers. Scientists have discovered that the tissues used to produce scales in reptiles are similar to those that produce feathers in birds. This suggests that there is a common ancestor between dinosaurs, birds, and reptiles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The strong evidence doesn’t just come from fossilised bones and similarities found across the skeleton, but from fossilised soft tissue – especially feathers. Many dinosaurs had not just some kind of body covering, but distinctive bird-like feathers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Birds evolved from a group of meat-eating dinosaurs called theropods. That’s the same group that Tyrannosaurus rex belonged to, although birds evolved from small theropods, not huge ones like T. rex. The oldest bird fossils are about 150 million years old.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-New work on old specimens, and the discoveries of dinosaur and early bird species in the field, supported the idea that dinosaurs were the direct ancestors of birds. Many features and behaviours that characterise living birds were also found in their dinosaur ancestors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Jack Horner’s discovery of dinosaur nesting grounds support the hypothesis that birds evolved from a group of dinosaurs? It provided evidence that dinosaurs raised and cared for their young in colonies like many birds.
