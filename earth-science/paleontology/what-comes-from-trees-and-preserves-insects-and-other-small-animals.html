<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Amber is the fossilized resin of a plant. Insects and other small organisms that were embedded in the resin until it hardened have been known to survive. Amber is used mainly to study or research more about resin fossils, although it is more frequently used in order to make jewellery and sculpture also.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Amber can also preserve plant matter (figure 11), bacteria, fungi, worms, snails, insects, spiders, and (more rarely) small vertebrates. Some pieces of amber contain water droplets and bubbles, products of the chemical breakdown of organic matter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Collectors and scientists have found not just bugs entombed in tree resin, but even animals as large as lizards, frogs and salamanders can be preserved in impressive detail. Skin, scales, fur and feathers are just some of the incredibly detailed features found in amber.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Most ambers from the ongoing Cenozoic era, beginning 66 million years ago (MYA), were produced by conifer trees, though some originate from flowering plants of the pea family. Almost all amber from the Mesozoic era, 252-66 MYA, was made by conifers such as cedars, redwoods and ancient ‘southern pines’.

<strong>Concept note-5:
