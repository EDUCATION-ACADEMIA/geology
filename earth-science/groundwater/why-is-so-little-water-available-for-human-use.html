<strong> Why is so little water available for human use? 
</strong>
<p>(A) most of the water on earth is fresh 
</p>
<p>(B) ** about 3% of all watger is fresh and most of it is frozen 
</p>
<p>(C) almost all water is found underground in unaccessible depths 
</p>
<p>(D) very little water is salty

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Most of the water is available in the form of seas and oceans which is salty in nature. This saline water has its limitations and cannot be used for many purposes. Around 2. 7% of water exists in the frozen state or as groundwater which is inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-3% of the earth’s water is fresh. 2.5% of the earth’s fresh water is unavailable: locked up in glaciers, polar ice caps, atmosphere, and soil; highly polluted; or lies too far under the earth’s surface to be extracted at an affordable cost. 0.5% of the earth’s water is available fresh water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Earth might seem like it has abundant water, but in fact less than 1 percent is available for human use. The rest is either salt water found in oceans, fresh water frozen in the polar ice caps, or too inaccessible for practical usage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Water is a finite resource: there are some 1 400 million cubic kilometres on earth and circulating through the hydrological cycle. Nearly all of this is salt water and most of the rest is frozen or under ground. Only one-hundredth of 1 percent of the world’s water is readily available for human use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The amount of usable water on Earth is limited as not all the sources of water can be used. Water present in oceans is too salty, much of the water is frozen in form of mountainous and polar glaciers. So, only a small portion is available for use.
