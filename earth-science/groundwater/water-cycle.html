<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The hydrologic cycle can be defined as the pathways of water as it moves in its various phases through the atmosphere, to the Earth, over and through the land, to the ocean, and back to the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Energy from the sun and the force of gravity drive the continual movement of water between pools. The sunâ€™s energy causes liquid water to evaporate into water vapor. Evapotranspiration is the main way water moves into the atmosphere from the land surface and oceans. Gravity causes water to flow downward on land.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-water cycle, also called hydrologic cycle, cycle that involves the continuous circulation of water in the Earth-atmosphere system. Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The hydrologic cycle involves the continuous circulation of water in the Earth-Atmosphere system. At its core, the water cycle is the motion of the water from the ground to the atmosphere and back again. Of the many processes involved in the hydrologic cycle, the most important are: evaporation.
