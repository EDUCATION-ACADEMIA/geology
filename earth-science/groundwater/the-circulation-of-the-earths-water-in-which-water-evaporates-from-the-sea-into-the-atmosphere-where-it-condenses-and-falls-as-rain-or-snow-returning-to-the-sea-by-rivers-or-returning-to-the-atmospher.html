<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The hydrological cycle of the earth is the sum total of all processes in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and back in form of precipitation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Water cycle is the cycle in which water circulates between the earth’s oceans, atmosphere, and land, involving precipitation as rain and snow, drainage in streams and rivers, and return to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Water at the surface of the ocean, rivers, and lakes can become water vapor and move into the atmosphere with a little added energy from the Sun through a process called evaporation. Snow and ice can also turn into water vapor, which is a process known as sublimation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What is evapotranspiration? the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from the soil and other surfaces and by transpiration from plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the Earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes is called as water cycle. Different steps of water cycle include evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and surface run-off.
