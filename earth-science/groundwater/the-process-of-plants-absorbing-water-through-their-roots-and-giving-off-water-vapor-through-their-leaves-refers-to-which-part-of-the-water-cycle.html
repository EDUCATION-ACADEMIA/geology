<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Evapotranspiration also includes transpiration, which is the water movement from the soil to the atmosphere via plants. Transpiration occurs when plants take up liquid water from the soil and release water vapor into the air from their leaves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-(1) The transportation of food from the leaves to other parts of the plant occurs in the vascular tissue, namely the phloem. This process of transporting food is known as translocation. The phloem consists of companion cells, sieve tubes, phloem parenchyma and fibres.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Osmosis plays a central role in the movement of water between cells and various compartments within plants. In the absence of transpiration, osmotic forces dominate the movement of water into roots.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This process of elimination of excess water from the plant body is known as transpiration. It is generally the evaporation of water from the surface of the leaves. During the process of transpiration, water molecules in the plant tissues are removed from the aerial parts of the plants.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Water is passively transported into the roots and then into the xylem. The forces of cohesion and adhesion cause the water molecules to form a column in the xylem. Water moves from the xylem into the mesophyll cells, evaporates from their surfaces and leaves the plant by diffusion through the stomata.
