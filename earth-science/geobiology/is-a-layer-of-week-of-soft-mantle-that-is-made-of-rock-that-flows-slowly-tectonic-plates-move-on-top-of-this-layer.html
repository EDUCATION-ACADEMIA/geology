<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The asthenosphere is a plastic, solid layer of the mantle made of rock that flows very slowly and allows tec-tonic plates to move on top of it. Beneath the asthenosphere is the mesosphere, the lower part of the mantle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Asthenosphere: The asthenosphere is the layer of weak or soft mantle made of solid rock that moves very slowly. The asthenosphere is located below the lithosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The asthenosphere is the denser, weaker layer beneath the lithospheric mantle. It lies between about 100 kilometers (62 miles) and 410 kilometers (255 miles) beneath Earth’s surface. The temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere are so high that rocks soften and partly melt, becoming semi-molten.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The asthenosphere is solid upper mantle material that is so hot that it behaves like plastic and can flow. The lithosphere rides on the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is solid but it can flow, like toothpaste. The asthenosphere and Lithosphere constitute the utmost concentric layers of our earth.
