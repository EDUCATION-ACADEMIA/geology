<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-However, because of the industrial revolution, the increase in pollution decreased the lichens in the environment and increase in smoke and soot, the trees appeared darker in color which helped the black moths to get camouflaged, and the white colored got easily attacked by the predators.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Scientists have discovered the specific mutation that famously turned moths black during the Industrial Revolution. In an iconic evolutionary case study, a black form of the peppered moth rapidly took over in industrial parts of the UK during the 1800s, as soot blackened the tree trunks and walls of its habitat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Rather than cause the black color mutation, the sooty conditions of the Industrial Revolution created the perfect backdrop for black moths to survive. As soot covered surfaces throughout Britain, black moths blended in with their background, escaping notice by predators and thriving.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-However, the Industrial Revolution changed the tree colors. After the pollution from the Industrial Revolution started affecting trees, most of the collected peppered moths were of the dark form. Click for more detail. As the trees darkened with soot, the light-colored moths were easier to see.
