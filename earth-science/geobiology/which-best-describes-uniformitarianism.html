<strong> Which best describes uniformitarianism? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The time it takes for erosion to occur has changed since Earth first formed. 
</p>
<p>(B) The movement of the continents no longer occurs because of changes in ocean currents. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The processes that shape the Earth continue as they have since the Earth formed. 
</p>
<p>(D) The formation of rock layers has slowed because humans have altered the environment.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism says that the processes that shape Earth are the same throughout time. That means if we observe a process shaping Earth today, we can assume the same process shaped Earth in the past and will shape Earth in the future all over the planet and even on other planets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-This is known as uniformitarianism: the idea that Earth has always changed in uniform ways and that the present is the key to the past. The principle of uniformitarianism is essential to understanding Earth’s history. However, prior to 1830, uniformitarianism was not the prevailing theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In geology, uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that “the present is the key to the past” and that geological events occur at the same rate now as they have always done, though many modern geologists no longer hold to a strict gradualism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-uniformitarianism, in geology, the doctrine suggesting that Earth’s geologic processes acted in the same manner and with essentially the same intensity in the past as they do in the present and that such uniformity is sufficient to account for all geologic change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Uniformitarianism is a theory based on the work of James Hutton and made popular by Charles Lyell in the 19th century. This theory states that the forces and processes observable at earth’s surface are the same that have shaped earth’s landscape throughout natural history.
