<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The planet was far too hot for gases and water to collect. The gases came from volcanic eruptions and from comets. Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor, or water in gas form, were in the first atmosphere. There was very little oxygen in the atmosphere until plants evolved.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Oxygen is produced by plants by the process of photosynthesis, earlier there were no plants and vegetation, which’s why no oxygen in the early atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Earth’s original atmosphere was rich in methane, ammonia, water vapour, and the noble gas neon, but it lacked free oxygen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The primordial earth’s atmosphere was reducing in nature, consisting of gases such as methane, ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water vapor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The energy from this catastrophic collision blew Earth’s existing atmosphere into space, created our Moon, and caused the entire planet to melt. Over time, this worldwide magma ocean released gases such as nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, creating a new atmosphere, the oldest version of the one we have today.
