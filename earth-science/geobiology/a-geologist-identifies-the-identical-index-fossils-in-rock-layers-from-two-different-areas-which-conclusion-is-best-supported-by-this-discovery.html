<strong> A geologist identifies the identical index fossils in rock layers from two different areas. Which conclusion is best supported by this discovery? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The deposition rate of the two rock layers was identical. 
</p>
<p>(B) The fossil organism evolved independently in the two separate areas 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The two rock layers were deposited at approximately the same time. 
</p>
<p>(D) The index fossil will also occur in sediment deposited on top of these rock layers.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A geologist identifies the identical index fossils in rock layers from two different areas. Which conclusion is best supported by this discovery? The deposition rate of the two rock layers was identical.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which best explains how index fossils found in sedimentary rock layers can be used to determine the approximate age of a rock layer? Each index fossil was formed during every geologic time period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Scientists specifically use index fossils to correlate strata found in different geographic locations. Index fossils are the preserved remains of plants and animals (primarily animals) that have existed in a limited geologic period, making them highly effective in determining the relative age of a rock layer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Index fossils are present in rock layers in different areas of the world indicated the rock layers formed during different periods of time and the rock layers are still forming. Explanation: Index fossils are fossils of organisms that lived during only one short period of time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If the same index fossil is found in different areas, the strata in each area were likely deposited at the same time. Thus, the principle of faunal succession makes it possible to determine the relative age of unknown fossils and correlate fossil sites across large discontinuous areas.
