<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Continental drift describes one of the earliest ways geologists thought continents moved over time. Today, the theory of continental drift has been replaced by the science of plate tectonics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The continental drift hypothesis was developed in the early part of the 20th century, mostly by Alfred Wegener. Wegener said that continents move around on Earth’s surface and that they were once joined together as a single supercontinent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-About 200 million years ago, all the continents on Earth were actually one huge “supercontinent” surrounded by one enormous ocean. This gigantic continent, called Pangaea, slowly broke apart and spread out to form the continents we know today. All Earth’s continents were once combined in one supercontinent, Pangaea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The system of ideas behind plate tectonics theory suggests that Earth’s outer shell (lithosphere) is divided into several plates that glide over the Earth’s rocky inner layer above the soft core (mantle). The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth’s mantle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-tectonics. According to the continental drift theory, the supercontinent Pangaea began to break up about 225-200 million years ago, eventually fragmenting into the continents as we know them today.
