<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sedimentary rocks are the product of 1) weathering of preexisting rocks, 2) transport of the weathering products, 3) deposition of the material, followed by 4) compaction, and 5) cementation of the sediment to form a rock. The latter two steps are called lithification.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Clastic Sedimentary Rocks: If the sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock. Clastic sedimentary rocks may have particles ranging in size from microscopic clay to huge boulders. Their names are based on their clast or grain size.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Sedimentary rocks are formed from deposits of pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organism that accumulate on the Earth’s surface. If sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock.
