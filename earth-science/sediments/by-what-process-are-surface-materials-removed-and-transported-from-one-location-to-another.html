<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Erosion is the geological process in which earthen materials are worn away and transported by natural forces such as wind or water.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the process of erosion, the removal of materials by the solution is called Corrosion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Soil erosion is a process of moving soil by water or wind-when the soil particles are detached and transported to a different location. This is a natural process that has occurred for eons of time. Water, wind, ice, and gravity are involved in moving soil materials.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sediment is a naturally occurring material that is broken down by processes of weathering and erosion, and is subsequently transported by the action of wind, water, or ice or by the force of gravity acting on the particles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Erosion also requires a medium to move material. Wind, water, and ice are the mediums primarily responsible for erosion. Finally, the process of erosion stops when the transported particles fall out of the transporting medium and settle on a surface. This process is called deposition.
