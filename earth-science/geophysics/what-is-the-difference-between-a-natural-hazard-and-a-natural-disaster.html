</title>
<meta name="description" content="Natural hazards and natural disasters are related but are not the same. A natural hazard is the threat of an event that will likely have a negative impact. A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community.Natural hazards are predominantly associated with natural processes and phenomena. Anthropogenic hazards, or human-induced hazards, are induced entirely or predominantly by human activities and choices.Disasters are divided into 2 basic groups: natural and man-made. Among the natural disasters are earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, floods, and fires. Among the man-made disasters are war, pollution, nuclear explosions, fires, hazardous materials exposures, explosions, and transportation accidents.Hazard is an event that has potential for causing injury/ loss of life or damage to property/environment. Disaster is an event that occurs suddenly/unexpectedly in most cases and disrupts the normal course of life in affected area. It results in loss or damage to life, property or environment.A hazard is any unusual event that has a potential to threaten peoples lives, their property and livelihoods. For example, typhoons, floods and fire are hazards. A hazard becomes a disaster when it happens where many people are living or have their livelihoods and causes damage to them and their property.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Natural hazards and natural disasters are related but are not the same. A natural hazard is the threat of an event that will likely have a negative impact. A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Natural hazards are predominantly associated with natural processes and phenomena. Anthropogenic hazards, or human-induced hazards, are induced entirely or predominantly by human activities and choices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Disasters are divided into 2 basic groups: natural and man-made. Among the natural disasters are earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, floods, and fires. Among the man-made disasters are war, pollution, nuclear explosions, fires, hazardous materials exposures, explosions, and transportation accidents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Hazard is an event that has potential for causing injury/ loss of life or damage to property/environment. Disaster is an event that occurs suddenly/unexpectedly in most cases and disrupts the normal course of life in affected area. It results in loss or damage to life, property or environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A hazard is any unusual event that has a potential to threaten peopleâ€™s lives, their property and livelihoods. For example, typhoons, floods and fire are hazards. A hazard becomes a disaster when it happens where many people are living or have their livelihoods and causes damage to them and their property.
