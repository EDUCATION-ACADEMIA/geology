<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Faults are cracks in the earth’s crust along which there is movement. These can be massive (the boundaries between the tectonic plates themselves) or very small. If tension builds up along a fault and then is suddenly released, the result is an earthquake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A fault is a fracture, or break, in Earth’s lithosphere, along which blocks of rock move past each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Faults which move along the direction of the dip plane are dip-slip faults and described as either normal or reverse (thrust), depending on their motion. Faults which move horizontally are known as strike-slip faults and are classified as either right-lateral or left-lateral.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A fault is a break in a rock mass along which movement has occurred. Faults occur when the rock is brittle. A. Certain terms help us describe faults.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fault is a fracture or crack where two rock blocks slide past one to another. If this movement may occur rapidly, it can be causes earthquike or slowly, in the form of creep. Types of faults include strike-slip faults, normal faults, reverse faults, thrust faults, and oblique-slip faults.
