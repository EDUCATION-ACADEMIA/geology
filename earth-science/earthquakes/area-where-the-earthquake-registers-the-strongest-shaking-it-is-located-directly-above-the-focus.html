<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The area of the fault where the sudden rupture takes place is called the focus or hypocenter of the earthquake. The point on the Earth’s surface directly above the focus is called the epicenter of the earthquake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The point at the Earth’s surface directly above the focus is called the epicenter of the earthquake. At the epicenter, the strongest shaking occurs during an earthquake. Sometimes the ground surface breaks along the fault. Sometimes the movement is deep underground and the surface does not break.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The focus is point inside the earth where the earthquake started, sometimes called the hypocenter, and the point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus is called the epicenter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Seismic waves travel faster through hard rock than through softer rock and sediments like soil and sand. But as the waves pass from harder to softer rocks, they slow and their strength increases, so shaking is more intense where the ground is softer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An earthquake is the sudden movement of Earth’s crust at a fault line. The location where an earthquake begins is called the epicenter. An earthquake’s most intense shaking is often felt near the epicenter.
