<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-For the large majority of earthquakes, deaths and injury are primarily related to building damage. Figure 1 shows that over 75% of deaths are caused by building collapse and almost 90% if follow-on disasters are excluded. the total deaths from earthquakes. The model for Ks is elaborated in the rest of this paper.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects caused by the ground shaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the earthquake vibrations push on a building at or near its natural frequency, it will begin to resonate, which causes the building to move with greater amplitude until some part of the building collapses or fails and the building falls apart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: When the lithospheric plates move, the surface of the earth vibrates and then these vibrations travel outwards from the epicentre in the form of waves, which leads to sudden movement and results in the collapse of buildings.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Ground movement during an earthquake is seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquake-related injuries result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects as a result of the ground shaking, or people trying to move more than a few feet during the shaking.
