<strong> Generally before and after a large earthquake there will be smaller earthquakes. The ones that happen before are called foreshocks. The ones that happen after are called aftershocks. Scientists don’t really know if an earthquake is a foreshock until the bigger earthquake occurs. What do they call the ones that happen AFTER the large earthquake?

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-"Foreshock” and “aftershock” are relative terms. Foreshocks are earthquakes that precede larger earthquakes in the same location. An earthquake cannot be identified as a foreshock until after a larger earthquake in the same area occurs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Aftershocks can continue over a period of weeks, months, or years. In general, the larger the mainshock, the larger and more numerous the aftershocks, and the longer they will continue. Foreshocks are relatively smaller earthquakes that precede the largest earthquake in a series, which is termed the mainshock.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Foreshocks arise from rough faults One leading theory proposes that foreshocks result from an acceleration of slipping movements along a fault. This movement, known as aseismic slip, triggers small earthquakes as it extends across ever-larger areas of the fault and speeds up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This means that there is about a 94% chance that any earthquake will NOT be a foreshock. In California, about half of the biggest earthquakes were preceded by foreshocks; the other half were not.
