<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth’s outer shell is divided into large slabs of solid rock, called “plates, ” that glide over Earth’s mantle, the rocky inner layer above Earth’s core. Earth’s solid outer layer, which includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, is called the lithosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In plate tectonics, Earth’s outermost layer, or lithosphere-made up of the crust and upper mantle-is broken into large rocky plates. These plates lie on top of a partially molten layer of rock called the asthenosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Tectonic Plates The system of ideas behind plate tectonics theory suggests that Earth’s outer shell (lithosphere) is divided into several plates that glide over the Earth’s rocky inner layer above the soft core (mantle).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-This concept is commonly known as the theory of plate tectonics. This theory describes how the Earth’s lithosphere is broken up into about a dozen plates or so which slide by, collide with or move away from each other as new ocean floor is created.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Tectonic plates are the rocky pieces of the Earth’s crust. These pieces float on top of the melted rock of the mantle, another layer of the Earth found between the core and the crust.
