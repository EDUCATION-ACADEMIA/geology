<meta name="description" content="The main heat transfer mechanism in the Earths mantle is convection, a thermally driven process where heating at depth causes material to expand and become less dense, causing it to rise while being replaced by complimentary cool material that sinks.The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. In conduction, heat is transferred as atoms collide. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is called convection. Conduction brings hot material up toward the surface.This material moves into the mantle above the plate and causes the mantle to melt. This liquid rock, called magma, rises to the surface because it is less dense then the surrounding rock. If the magma reaches the surface of the Earth, a volcano forms. As the mantle rocks melt they form magma.Mantle convection describes the movement of the mantle as it transfers heat from the white-hot core to the brittle lithosphere. The mantle is heated from below, cooled from above, and its overall temperature decreases over long periods of time. All these elements contribute to mantle convection.As hot material rises from the lower mantle into the upper mantle, its cooler material sinks into the lower mantle. This movement causes the tectonic plates to shift. The tectonic plates sit above the mantle because they are less dense; this phenomenon is known as isostasy.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The main heat transfer mechanism in the Earth’s mantle is convection, a thermally driven process where heating at depth causes material to expand and become less dense, causing it to rise while being replaced by complimentary cool material that sinks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. In conduction, heat is transferred as atoms collide. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is called convection. Conduction brings hot material up toward the surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This material moves into the mantle above the plate and causes the mantle to melt. This liquid rock, called magma, rises to the surface because it is less dense then the surrounding rock. If the magma reaches the surface of the Earth, a volcano forms. As the mantle rocks melt they form magma.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Mantle convection describes the movement of the mantle as it transfers heat from the white-hot core to the brittle lithosphere. The mantle is heated from below, cooled from above, and its overall temperature decreases over long periods of time. All these elements contribute to mantle convection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-As hot material rises from the lower mantle into the upper mantle, its cooler material sinks into the lower mantle. This movement causes the tectonic plates to shift. The tectonic plates sit above the mantle because they are less dense; this phenomenon is known as isostasy.
