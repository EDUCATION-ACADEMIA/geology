Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.Effects that are found at a divergent boundary between oceanic plates include: a submarine mountain range such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; volcanic activity in the form of fissure eruptions; shallow earthquake activity; creation of new seafloor and a widening ocean basin.">

<strong> What are facts about divergent boundaries? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Convection, radiation, conduction. 
</p>
<p>(B) Sides of plates are rocky and jagged, which holds the plates together. When forces push them to move earthquakes can occur, such as on the San Andreas fault in California. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Most occur at mid ocean ridges where new crust is added during sea floor spreading. Where pieces of Earth’s crust diverge on land, a rift valley occurs. 
</p>
<p>(D) When 2 oceanic plates converge the more dense plate sinks below the less dense plate. When a dense oceanic plate converges with a continental plate, it can push up the continental plate forming mountains and volcanoes. When 2 continental plates converge, the collision plates converge, the collision squeeze the crust into high mountain ranges.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Seafloor spreading occurs at divergent plate boundaries. As tectonic plates slowly move away from each other, heat from the mantle’s convection currents makes the crust more plastic and less dense. The less-dense material rises, often forming a mountain or elevated area of the seafloor. Eventually, the crust cracks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mid-ocean ridges occur along divergent plate boundaries, where new ocean floor is created as the Earth’s tectonic plates spread apart. As the plates separate, molten rock rises to the seafloor, producing enormous volcanic eruptions of basalt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The features most commonly associated with divergent boundaries between tectonic plates are rift valleys, ocean ridges, fissure volcanoes, and underwater mountain chains.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary. Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Effects that are found at a divergent boundary between oceanic plates include: a submarine mountain range such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; volcanic activity in the form of fissure eruptions; shallow earthquake activity; creation of new seafloor and a widening ocean basin.
