<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Plate Tectonics Theory The plates are moved around on Earth’s surface by seafloor spreading. Convection in the mantle drives seafloor spreading. Oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges. The crust moves outward from the ridge over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Hot spot volcanoes occur far from plate boundaries. Because the hot spot is caused by mantle plumes that exist below the tectonic plates, as the plates move, the hot spot does not, and may create a chain of volcanoes on the Earth’s surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Hess discovered that the oceans were shallower in the middle and identified the presence of Mid Ocean Ridges, raised above the surrounding generally flat sea floor (abyssal plain) by as much as 1.5 km.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A mantle plume is an area under the rocky outer layer of Earth, called the crust, where magma is hotter than the surrounding magma. The heat from this extra hot magma causes melting and thinning of the rocky crust, which leads to widespread volcanic activity on Earth’s surface above the plume.

<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which of the following is caused by mantle plumes that rise toward the surface of Earth? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>

</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 5 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which of the following processes that occurs in mantle plumes results to hot mantle rock rising to shallower depths in the Earth? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What place where an unusual hot part of the mantle called mantle plume rises through the crust causing volcanic activity? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 7 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which theory explains that new ocean floor at mid-ocean ridge was formed and spread away from the ridge in both direction? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How did the discovery of mid-ocean ridges help to develop the theory of plate tectonics? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
</strong>
