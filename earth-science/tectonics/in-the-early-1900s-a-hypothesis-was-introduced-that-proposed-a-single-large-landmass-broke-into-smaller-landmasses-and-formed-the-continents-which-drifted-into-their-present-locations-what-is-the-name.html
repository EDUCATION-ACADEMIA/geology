<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Alfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent named Pangaea, meaning all earth in ancient Greek. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis continental drift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Continental drift describes one of the earliest ways geologists thought continents moved over time. Today, the theory of continental drift has been replaced by the science of plate tectonics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Continental drift is the hypothesis that states that the continents once formed a single landmass, broke up, and drifted to their present locations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main reason that Wegener’s hypothesis was not accepted was because he suggested no mechanism for moving the continents. He thought the force of Earth’s spin was sufficient to cause continents to move, but geologists knew that rocks are too strong for this to be true.

<strong>Concept note-5:
