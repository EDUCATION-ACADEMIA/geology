<strong> In subduction zones, dense pieces of oceanic crust are pulled downward toward the mantle. What is the result of this? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The oceanic crust crumples and forms a mid-ocean ridge. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** New crust is formed on the opposite end of the plate as it is pulled away from its neighbor. 
</p>
<p>(C) The surface area of the lithosphere decreases as pieces of tectonic plates are slowly submerged. 
</p>
<p>(D) The oceanic crust begins to thicken and build up until it is slowly transformed into continental crust.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In subduction zones, dense pieces of oceanic crust are pulled downward toward the mantle. What is the result of this? The oceanic crust crumples and forms a mid-ocean ridge .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As a crustal plate moves further from an oceanic ridge, it cools and becomes increasingly dense. This causes it to sink beneath the continental crust in a subduction zone. The weight of this sinking, cooling plate causes a major pulling action, which causes the rest of the plate to be pulled downwards as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Whenever a subduction zone is formed, the subducted plate will end up being partially melted by the earth’s internal magma and molten. This melting leads to heat being transferred upwards and uplifting the crust, eventually developing into a volcano.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Subduction happens where tectonic plates crash into each other instead of spreading apart. At subduction zones, the edge of the denser plate subducts, or slides, beneath the less-dense one. The denser lithospheric material then melts back into the Earth’s mantle. Seafloor spreading creates new crust.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An oceanic plate will sink back into the mantle. Remember, oceanic plates are formed from mantle material at midocean ridges. Young oceanic lithosphere is hot and buoyant (low density) when it forms at a midocean ridge.
