<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Alfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent named Pangaea, meaning all earth in ancient Greek. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis continental drift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the early 20th century, Wegener published a paper explaining his theory that the continental landmasses were “drifting” across the Earth, sometimes plowing through oceans and into each other. He called this movement continental drift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Wegener’s continental drift theory introduced the idea of moving continents to geoscience. He proposed that Earth (opens in new tab) must have once been a single supercontinent before breaking up to form several different continents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Continental drift is the hypothesis that states that the continents once formed a single landmass, broke up, and drifted to their present locations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fossil Evidence One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined.
