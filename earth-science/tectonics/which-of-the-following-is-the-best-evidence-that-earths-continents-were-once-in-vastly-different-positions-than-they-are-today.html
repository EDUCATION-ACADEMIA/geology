<strong> Which of the following is the best evidence that Earth’s continents were once in vastly different positions than they are today? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Penguins only found in southern hemisphere 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Fossils of tropical plants found in Antartica 
</p>
<p>(C) Volcanoes encircling Pacific Ocean 
</p>
<p>(D) Major rivers from deltas from continental erosion

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Fossils of tropical plants are found in Antarctica. Explanation: That option is the best evidence from the given because it shows that once tropical plants and the continent that today is Antarctica were once together. There is no other form that plants could travel there.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The rock formations of eastern North America, Western Europe, and northwestern Africa were later found to have a common origin, and they overlapped in time with the presence of Gondwanaland. Together, these discoveries supported the existence of Pangea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the early part of the 20th century, scientists began to put together evidence that the continents could move around on Earth’s surface. The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climatic zones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Scientists have found that rocks on the east coast of South America are the same as rocks found on the west coast of Africa. These rocks are different from rocks found in other places on Earth, suggesting that the continents were once connected. Plant and animal fossils also reveal evidence.
