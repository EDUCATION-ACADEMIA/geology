<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climatic zones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Glossopteris fossil is found in Australia, Antarctica, India, South Africa, and South America-all the southern continents. Now, the Glossopteris seed is known to be large and bulky and therefore could not have drifted or flown across the oceans to a separate continent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There are many examples of fossils found on separate continents and nowhere else, suggesting the continents were once joined. If Continental Drift had not occurred, the alternative explanations would be: The species evolved independently on separate continents – contradicting Darwin’s theory of evolution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa seem to fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and Wegener discovered their rock layers “fit” just as clearly. South America and Africa were not the only continents with similar geology.
