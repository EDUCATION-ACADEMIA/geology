<strong> Some regions of the Earth are more likely to have earthquakes, volcanoes, or hot springs than other regions. What do these places most likely have in common?

<p>(A) ** They are regions where tectonic plates meet. 
</p>
<p>(B) They are regions in the northern hemisphere. 
</p>
<p>(C) They are regions with big cities. 
</p>
<p>(D) They are desert regions.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Some regions of the Earth are more likely to have earthquakes, volcanoes, or hot springs than other regions. They are regions where tectonic plates meet. Thus, option ‘A’ is the correct option.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Ring of Fire, also referred to as the Circum-Pacific Belt, is a path along the Pacific Ocean characterized by active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. The majority of Earth’s volcanoes and earthquakes take place along the Ring of Fire.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Over 80 per cent of large earthquakes occur around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the ‘Ring of Fire’; this where the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the surrounding plates. The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earthquakes are usually caused when underground rock suddenly breaks and there is rapid motion along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Volcanic eruptions occur only in certain places and do not occur randomly. This is because the Earth’s crust is broken into a series of slabs known as tectonic plates. These plates are rigid, but they “float” on a hotter, softer layer in the Earth’s interior.
