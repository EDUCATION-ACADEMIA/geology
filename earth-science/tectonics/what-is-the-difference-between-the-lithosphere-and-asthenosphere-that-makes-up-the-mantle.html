<meta name="description" content="The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The asthenosphere is solid upper mantle material that is so hot that it behaves plastically and can flow. The lithosphere rides on the asthenosphere.The lithosphere (litho:rock; sphere:layer) is the strong, upper 100 km of the Earth. The lithosphere is the tectonic plate we talk about in plate tectonics. The asthenosphere (a:without; stheno:strength) is the weak and easily deformed layer of the Earth that acts as a lubricant for the tectonic plates to slide over.The Layers of the Earth The mantle is the intermediate layer of the Earth and can be subdivided into the inner and outer mantle. Most of the mantle is a thick fluid that moves in currents, but the very outermost portion of the outer mantle is solid. This portion and the solid crust make up the lithosphere.The crust and the upper layer of the mantle together make up a zone of rigid, brittle rock called the Lithosphere. The layer below the rigid lithosphere is a zone of asphalt-like consistancy called the Asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.How do the lithosphere and asthenosphere differ? The lithosphere differs from the asthenosphere because the lithosphere is the solid outer layer of the earth and the asthenosphere is below the mantle and made of slow flowing rock.">

<strong> What is the difference between the lithosphere and asthenosphere that makes up the mantle? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The lithosphere is ismade of dense solid meal whle the asthenosphere is made of liquid molten metal 
</p>
<p>(B) The lithosphere is a mixture of gasses while the asthenosphere is made of solid rock 
</p>
<p>(C) The lithosphere is molten rock that moves while the asthenosphere is ridid and thin 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The lithosphere is made of solid rock while the asthenosphere is more flexible hot rock that moves. 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The lithosphere is the outermost mechanical layer, which behaves as a brittle, rigid solid. The asthenosphere is solid upper mantle material that is so hot that it behaves plastically and can flow. The lithosphere rides on the asthenosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The lithosphere (litho:rock; sphere:layer) is the strong, upper 100 km of the Earth. The lithosphere is the tectonic plate we talk about in plate tectonics. The asthenosphere (a:without; stheno:strength) is the weak and easily deformed layer of the Earth that acts as a “lubricant” for the tectonic plates to slide over.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Layers of the Earth The mantle is the intermediate layer of the Earth and can be subdivided into the inner and outer mantle. Most of the mantle is a thick fluid that moves in currents, but the very outermost portion of the outer mantle is solid. This portion and the solid crust make up the lithosphere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The crust and the upper layer of the mantle together make up a zone of rigid, brittle rock called the Lithosphere. The layer below the rigid lithosphere is a zone of asphalt-like consistancy called the Asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is the part of the mantle that flows and moves the plates of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-How do the lithosphere and asthenosphere differ? The lithosphere differs from the asthenosphere because the lithosphere is the solid outer layer of the earth and the asthenosphere is below the mantle and made of slow flowing rock.
