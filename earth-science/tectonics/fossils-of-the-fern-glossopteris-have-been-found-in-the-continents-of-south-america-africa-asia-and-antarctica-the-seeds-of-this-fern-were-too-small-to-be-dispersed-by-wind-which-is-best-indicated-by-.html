<strong> Fossils of the fern Glossopteris have been found in the continents of South America, Africa, Asia, and Antarctica. The seeds of this fern were too small to be dispersed by wind. Which is best indicated by the presence of Glossopteris fossils on these continents? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Fossils were much better preserved in the southern continents. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The landmasses were joined together in pre-historic times. 
</p>
<p>(C) Glossopteris was versatile enough to adapt to all climates. 
</p>
<p>(D) The northern climate regions were not suitable for plant growth.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Where are Glossopteris fossils found? Glossopteris flourished in Gondwana, which is now the present-day continent of South America, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Reaching as tall as 30 meters, the Glossopteris emerged during the early Permian period (299 million years ago) and became the dominant land plant species until the end of the Permian. The Glossopteris fossil is found in Australia, Antarctica, India, South Africa, and South America-all the southern continents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Where are Glossopteris fossils found? Glossopteris flourished in Gondwana, which is now the present-day continents of South America, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica. Large numbers of fossils are also found in India.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Q14: If glossopteris fossils are found in Antarctica, what is the climate of this continent before? Based on the sheer numbers of leaf fossils found and grew in a temperate climate, at middle to high latitude, therefore the climate of continent before has a temperate climate, wet to warm climate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-At about 270 million years old, the stumps come from an extinct species of tree known as Glossopteris. The fossils promise to offer paleontologists insights into the prehistoric climate and ecology of Antarctica, and the dramatic ecological changes that were about to sweep across the continent.
