<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Downcutting occurs as a river carves out a canyon or valley, cutting down into the earth and eroding away rock. Downcutting happens during flooding. When large amounts of water are moved through a river channel, large rocks and boulders are carried too.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Canyon itself was carved by the Colorado River and the wind that caused the surface of the sedimentary rocks to become exposed and erode over time. The erosion of the Grand Canyon by winds, rains and the amazing strength of the Colorado River created the marvelous views and exposed magnificent caves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, in the U.S. state of Arizona, is a product of tectonic uplift. It has been carved, over millions of years, as the Colorado River cuts down through the Colorado Plateau.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main cause of the erosion that formed the Grand Canyon was water; most scientists agree that it formed when the Colorado River started carving through layers of volcanic rock and sediment between five million and six million years ago.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Grand Canyon was created by mechanical weathering (and its pal erosion), as water from the Colorado River pushed past the rocky surface of the canyon for millions of years, making a deeper and deeper V-shape.
