<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Answer and Explanation: A well-tested explanation that explains a lot of observations is a theory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A theory is a well-established, tested explanation that provides a unified description of some aspect of the natural world. A theory is based on substantiated data, repeated testing, and the consensus of a wide group of scientists/researchers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A theory is a carefully thought-out explanation for observations of the natural world that has been constructed using the scientific method, and which brings together many facts and hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A theory is a well-supported explanation of observations. A scientific law is a statement that summarizes the relationship between variables. An experiment is a controlled method of testing a hypothesis.
