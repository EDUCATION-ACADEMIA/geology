<title>The first installment to the Theory of Plate Tectonics was Alfred Wegeners Hypothsis of Continental Drift. What was the basic idea of the hypothesis?
</title>
<meta name="description" content="Alfred Wegener in Greenland. Plate tectonics is the theory that Earths land masses are in constant motion. The realization that Earths land masses move was first proposed by Alfred Wegener, which he called continental drift.Alfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into a single supercontinent named Pangaea, meaning all earth in ancient Greek. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis continental drift.Alfred Wegener, in the first three decades of this century, and DuToit in the 1920s and 1930s gathered evidence that the continents had moved. They based their idea of continental drift on several lines of evidence: fit of the continents, paleoclimate indicators, truncated geologic features, and fossils.Continental drift over millions of years was caused by plate tectonics. And plate tectonics also explained how the movement of the plates create volcanoes and earthquakes, and how the collision between continents gave rise to huge mountain ranges.The drifting of tectonic plates is an on-going process that has changed the configuration of the continents since their formation in Archean time. This hypothesis first proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener, a German Meteorologist, was not widely accepted until after 1960.">

<p>(A) Modern continents are where they have always been. 
</p>
<p>(B) Modern continents are made up of many small land mass that have fused together. 
</p>
<p>(C) ** Modern continents were once part of a super-continent that broke part. 
</p>
<p>(D) Modern continents are slowly mnoving toward one another.
