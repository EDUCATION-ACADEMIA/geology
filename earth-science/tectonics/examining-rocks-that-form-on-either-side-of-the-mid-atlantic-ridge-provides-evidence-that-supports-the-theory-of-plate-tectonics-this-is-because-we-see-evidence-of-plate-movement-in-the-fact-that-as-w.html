<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Mid-ocean ridges occur along divergent plate boundaries, where new ocean floor is created as the Earth’s tectonic plates spread apart. As the plates separate, molten rock rises to the seafloor, producing enormous volcanic eruptions of basalt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Evidence for Tectonic Plates Earthquakes, mountain building and volcanic activity occur mostly at the boundaries of the moving plates. Only shallow earthquakes occur where plates diverge at mid-ocean ridges, whereas earthquakes extend to great depth where plates converge at subduction zones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents. This suggests that the continents were once joined. For example, fossils of Mesosaurus, a freshwater reptile, have been found both in Brazil and western Africa.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which observation about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge region that best evidence that the seafloor has been spreading for millions of years? Seafloor bedrock is younger near the ridge and older father away.
