<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Wegener used fossil evidence to support his continental drift hypothesis. The fossils of these organisms are found on lands that are now far apart. Grooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers are found today on different continents very close to the equator.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Alfred Wegener, in the first three decades of this century, and DuToit in the 1920s and 1930s gathered evidence that the continents had moved. They based their idea of continental drift on several lines of evidence: fit of the continents, paleoclimate indicators, truncated geologic features, and fossils.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Wegener used matching mountain ranges across different continents as evidence to support his hypothesis of Continental Drift. Wegener used matching matching fossils of the same organisms on different continents as evidence to support his hypothesis of Continental Drift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Wegener’s evidence included the fit of the continents, the distribution of ancient fossils, the placement of similar rocks and structures on the opposite sides of oceans, and indicators of ancient climate found in locations where those climates do not exist today.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Fossil Evidence One type of evidence that strongly supported the Theory of Continental Drift is the fossil record. Scientists have found fossils of similar types of plants and animals in rocks of similar age. These rocks were on the shores of different continents.
