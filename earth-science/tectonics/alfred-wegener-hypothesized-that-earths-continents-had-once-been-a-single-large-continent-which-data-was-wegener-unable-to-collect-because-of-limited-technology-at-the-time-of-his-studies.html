<strong> Alfred Wegener hypothesized that Earth’s continents had once been a single large continent. Which data was Wegener unable to collect because of limited technology at the time of his studies? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Similar rocks in similar structures are found on different continents across Earth. 
</p>
<p>(B) Facing coastlines of adjacent continents fit together like puzzle pieces. 
</p>
<p>(C) The same fossils are found on continents separated by oceans. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The ages of deep-ocean rocks indicate seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
