<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The four pieces of evidence for the continental drift include continents fitting together like a puzzle, scattering ancient fossils, rocks, mountain ranges, and the old climatic zones’ locations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Evidence for Tectonic Plates Earthquakes, mountain building and volcanic activity occur mostly at the boundaries of the moving plates. Only shallow earthquakes occur where plates diverge at mid-ocean ridges, whereas earthquakes extend to great depth where plates converge at subduction zones.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Coastline Matching The similarity of coastlines for different continents suggests that they may once have been connected. But the fact that they were separated by sometimes thousands of miles suggested continental drift or plate tectonics .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The coastlines of South America and West Africa seem to match up. Scientists have found that rocks on the east coast of South America are the same as rocks found on the west coast of Africa. These rocks are different from rocks found in other places on Earth, suggesting that the continents were once connected.

<p>What is the evidence that supported the hypothesis of continental drift? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What is the evidence in support of plate tectonics theory? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What are the coastline matching evidence that support plate movement? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What evidence shows that the coastlines of the continents can be joined together like the pieces of a puzzle? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 5 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What are some pieces of evidence that support the continents were once joined together in a super continent? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What were two big pieces of evidence that suggested the continents were once connected? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 7 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What are three lines of evidence that are used to support continental drift and the theory of plate tectonics? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Which coastline most closely match each other and are therefore used as evidence to support Wegener’s theory? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How is plate tectonics supported by the apparent fit of the continental coastlines *?
