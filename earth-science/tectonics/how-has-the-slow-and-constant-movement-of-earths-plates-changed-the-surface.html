<strong> How has the slow and constant movement of Earth’s plates changed the surface? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** it changed the location of the continents, the shape of the oceans, causes earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain ranges, deep ocean trenches. 
</p>
<p>(B) it changed the shape and size of the sun, the size of the moon, and Earth’s place in the galaxy.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Plate motions cause mountains to rise where plates push together, or converge, and continents to fracture and oceans to form where plates pull apart, or diverge. The continents are embedded in the plates and drift passively with them, which over millions of years results in significant changes in Earth’s geography.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Earth’s surface is active according to tectonic theory, moving as much as 1-2 inches a year. The many tectonic plates shift and interact all the time. This motion reshapes the Earth’s outer layer. Earthquakes, volcanoes and mountains are the result of this process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Plate movement slowly breaks apart the supercontinent. This sends pieces across the ocean to collide and form a new supercontinent, which will also eventually fragment. We are currently in the middle of one of these cycles. About 150 million years ago, a rift opened up within the supercontinent called Pangaea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The movement of these tectonic plates is likely caused by convection currents in the molten rock in Earth’s mantle below the crust. Earthquakes and volcanoes are the short-term results of this tectonic movement. The long-term result of plate tectonics is the movement of entire continents over millions of years (Fig.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-How have plate movements caused changes in the positions and shapes of Earth’s landmasses? According to the theory, the continents are embedded in lithospheric plates, as the plates move it caries Earth’s landmasses with them. The continents have moved, or drifted from one location to another overtime.
