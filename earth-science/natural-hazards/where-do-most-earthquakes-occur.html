The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earths crust where tectonic plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up. Finally, the pressure between the plates is so great that they break loose.Subduction zones are places where two of the Earths plates collide, with one descending beneath the other. Many earthquakes occur along these zones, usually near the top of the descending plate, where it meets the overlying mantle.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Oceanic trenches are narrow, deep troughs that mark where two plates converge, usually along the edge of a continent or island are where andesitic volcanoes typically occur. Earthquakes originate in Benioff zones, zones that slope downward from the trenches and under the overlying rocks at 30 to 60 degrees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Earthquakes occur along faults, which are fractures between blocks of rock that allow the blocks to move relative to one another. Faults are caused by the bumping and sliding that plates do and are more common near the edges of the plates.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Over 80 per cent of large earthquakes occur around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, an area known as the ‘Ring of Fire’; this where the Pacific plate is being subducted beneath the surrounding plates. The Ring of Fire is the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earth’s crust where tectonic plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up. Finally, the pressure between the plates is so great that they break loose.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Subduction zones are places where two of the Earth’s plates collide, with one descending beneath the other. Many earthquakes occur along these zones, usually near the top of the descending plate, where it meets the overlying mantle.
