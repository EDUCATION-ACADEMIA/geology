<p>(A) ** Earthquakes and weather are not related. 
</p>
<p>(B) Earthquakes cannot happen in cold weather. 
</p>
<p>(C) Atmospheric conditions cause both earthquakes and weather.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The weather has been warmer than usual in a town in California. A student wants to know if warmer weather means that an earthquake is more likely to happen. Which statement about earthquakes and weather is true? Earthquakes and weather are not related.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Ground-shaking from earthquakes can cause buildings or bridges to collapse, disrupt utility services and trigger events such as avalanches, fires, floods, landslides and tsunamis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The global increase in intense floods, storms, droughts, and heat waves has a likely and ominous link to climate change.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earthquakes are caused due to sudden tectonic movements in the earth’s crust. When the tectonic plates slide over one another, there is a cause of orogeny which results in earthquakes and volcanoes. These disturbances cause vibrations that spread in all directions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An earthquake is the shifting of the Earth’s plates, which results in a sudden shaking of the ground that can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. Within seconds, mild initial shaking can strengthen and become violent. Earthquakes happen without warning and can happen at any time of year.
