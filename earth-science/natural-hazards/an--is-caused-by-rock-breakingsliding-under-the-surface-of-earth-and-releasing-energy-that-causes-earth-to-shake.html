<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sol. The correct answer is option ”c”. Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What are Seismic Waves? Seismic waves are caused by the sudden movement of materials within the Earth, such as slip along a fault during an earthquake. Volcanic eruptions, explosions, landslides, avalanches, and even rushing rivers can also cause seismic waves.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Seismic waves are the waves of energy caused by the sudden breaking of rock within the earth or an explosion. They are the energy that travels through the earth and is recorded on seismographs. There are several different kinds of seismic waves, and they all move in different ways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Faults are cracks in the earth’s crust along which there is movement. These can be massive (the boundaries between the tectonic plates themselves) or very small. If tension builds up along a fault and then is suddenly released, the result is an earthquake.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When a fault ruptures, seismic waves are propagated in all directions, causing the ground to vibrate at frequencies ranging from about 0.1 to 30 Hertz. Buildings vibrate as a consequence of the ground shaking; damage takes place if the building cannot withstand these vibrations.
