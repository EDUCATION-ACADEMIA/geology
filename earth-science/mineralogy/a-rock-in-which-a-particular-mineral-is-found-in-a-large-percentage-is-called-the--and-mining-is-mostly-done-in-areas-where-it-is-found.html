<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A rock that has a large concentration of a particular mineral is called the ore of that mineral. All minerals have a definite chemical composition and can have one or more elements in them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Rocks from which minerals are mined are known as ores.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Ore is a deposit in Earthâ€™s crust of one or more valuable minerals. The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Mineral deposits may form in sedimentary rocks through the erosion of ore-bearing rocks or through the mobilization of ore-bearing fluids through sedimentary rock. Examples: Sediments eroded from older rocks: Sandstone hosted copper. Carbonates (Limestone, Dolostone): MVT Lead-Zinc Deposits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A rock from which a particular mineral can be profitably extracted is called ore. The ores of metallic minerals are generally located in igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks.
