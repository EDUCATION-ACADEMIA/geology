<strong> Amanda is holding a compass and notices that the north pole of the compass points towards the north pole of the Earth. She is confused because she knows from her science classes that the north poles of two magnets will repel each other. How can she explain this phenomenon? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** the geographic north pole of the Earth is actually near the Earth’s magnetic south pole 
</p>
<p>(B) The north pole of the compass was probably pushed in the wrong direction by a nearby magnet 
</p>
<p>(C) The Earth’s magnetic poles may have reversed positions while Amanda was observing the compass 
</p>
<p>(D) The Earth’s poles are not strong enough to attract any handheld magnets, so it was probably a coincidence that the compass pointed towards the north pole.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-She is confused because she knows from her science classes that the north poles of two magnets will repel each other. How can she explain this phenomenon? The Earth’s poles are not strong enough to attract any handheld magnets, so it was probably a coincidence that the compass pointed towards the north pole.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Earth’s south magnetic pole is near Earth’s geographic north. Earth’s magnetic north pole is near Earth’s geographic south. That’s why the north pole of a compass points toward north because that’s where Earth’s south magnetic pole is located and they attract.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If you mean the geographical North Pole, the needle would point south, as that is the only direction one can go from there; more specifically it would point south along the 112.4 degrees west longitude meridian towards the magnetic north pole at 82 degrees north, which is where compasses point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earth’s geographic North Pole is close to the magnetic south pole. Magnets allowed to move freely align themselves to point north. The north pole on a compass is attracted to Earth’s magnetic north pole. The north pole on a compass is attracted to Earth’s magnetic south pole.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The magnetic properties of a substance can be determined by examining its electron configuration: If it has unpaired electrons, then the substance is paramagnetic and if all electrons are paired, the substance is then diamagnetic.
