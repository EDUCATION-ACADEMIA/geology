<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An inference is a logical conclusion based on previous experiences, observations, and knowledge. It is an educated guess. Inferences can lead us to a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What is an Inference? An inference is an educated guess about exactly what an author is trying to communicate. Writers don’t always connect all the dots for you – sometimes they leave it up to the reader to get the point.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A scientific hypothesis is a tentative, testable explanation for a phenomenon in the natural world. It’s the initial building block in the scientific method. Many describe it as an “educated guess” based on prior knowledge and observation. While this is true, a hypothesis is more informed than a guess.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Observation: something noticed or perceived through your senses, such as: seeing, hearing, or touching something directly. “I hear thunder” is an observation. Inference: a conclusion that is developed through evidence, reasoning, or past observations. “Because I hear thunder, it will rain” is an inference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-“I don’t see Anne. She said she was tired, so she must have gone home to bed.” “Sarah’s been at the gym a lot; she must be trying to lose weight.” “Jacko is a dog, and all dogs love belly rubs. So Jacko must love belly rubs.”
