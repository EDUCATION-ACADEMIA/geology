<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This is a difference of about 500 kilometers between the Geographic North and Magnetic North poles! This difference is called the magnetic inclination. Magnetic deviation is the error of a compass needle including nearby metallic objects. Magnetic inclination varies according to where you are located on the globe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There is such a pole in each hemisphere, and the poles are called as “the geomagnetic north pole” and “the geomagnetic south pole", respectively. On the other hand, the magnetic poles are the points at which magnetic needles become vertical.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Geographic north (also called “true north") is the direction towards the fixed point we call the North Pole. Magnetic north is the direction towards the north magnetic pole, which is a wandering point where the Earth’s magnetic field goes vertically down into the planet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-geomagnetic field, magnetic field associated with Earth. It is primarily dipolar (i.e., it has two poles, the geomagnetic North and South poles) on Earth’s surface. Away from the surface the dipole becomes distorted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The degree of difference between the position of these two poles when seen at various locations is called magnetic declination. These angles allow navigators to determine their actual geographic position. Charts and handbooks for navigation regularly update these values and are published by government agencies.
