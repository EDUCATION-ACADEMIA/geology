<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Colorado River has been carving away rock for the past five to six million years. Remember, the oldest rocks in Grand Canyon are 1.8 billion years old. The canyon is much younger than the rocks through which it winds.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-After the top layers of rock (green) eroded away, the Colorado River grew powerful and began to cut its way through the ancient rock, leaving the stunning canyon we see today. By around 6 million years ago, waters rushing off the Rockies had formed the mighty Colorado River.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-This natural landmark formed about five to six million years as erosion from the Colorado River cut a deep channel through layers of rock. The Grand Canyon contains some of the oldest exposed rock on Earth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon, in the U.S. state of Arizona, is a product of tectonic uplift. It has been carved, over millions of years, as the Colorado River cuts down through the Colorado Plateau.
