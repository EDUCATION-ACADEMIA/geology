<strong> A spaceship is traveling through space. Suddenly, its kinetic energy decreases. What is most likely to be true about the speed of the spaceship? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The speed increases as the kinetic energy is converted into speed. 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The speed decreases as the kinetic energy decreases. 
</p>
<p>(C) The speed remains the same because speed and kinetic energy are not related. 
</p>
<p>(D) The speed increases to make up for the decrease in kinetic energy.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A spaceship is traveling through space. Suddenly, its kinetic energy decreases. What is most likely to be true about the speed of the spaceship? The speed increases as the kinetic energy is converted into speed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-When two magnets have attractive forces between them and they are moved apart, kinetic energy is transferred into the magnets when they are released and they move back together. Changing the distance between two magnets changes the amount of energy that can be transferred into and out of a magnetic field.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Magnetic fields can be used to make electricity Moving a magnet around a coil of wire, or moving a coil of wire around a magnet, pushes the electrons in the wire and creates an electrical current. Electricity generators essentially convert kinetic energy (the energy of motion) into electrical energy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-And because magnets have north and south poles, the potential energy depends not only on the position within a field but also the magnetsâ€™ orientation. Again, you could increase the potential energy by moving the magnets opposite the direction of the magnetic force.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A we can say that this claim is true, this amis true, because if we move the magnetic field against the magnetic force of a magnet, the motion will make the magnetic field lines to compression, and this will lead to an increasing potential energy.
